# Wright_CSCI2270_FinalProject

For my final project I plan on designing a map of cities represented by a weighted non-directed graph.
The vertices and edges will be based on cities and their distances either in the state of Colorado or
captial cities in the United States. The edges between cities will contain information about the distance
between two adjacent cities as well as the estimated speed limit of the roads between them. This information
will be as accurate as possible and based off of Google maps estimates of distances and speed limits. My 
project will allow you to enter two cities and will solve for the quickest route from one city to another.
This quickest route will be based on the distances traveled from city to city as well as the speed at which
you can drive those distances. A linked list will allow for the storage of the shortest route.
